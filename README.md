# Anion Gap Calculator

**Author:** Claire Louise Price  
**Website:** [Acid-Base Tools Homepage](https://claireprice.github.io/acid-base-tools-homepage/)  

## Overview

This web-based tool calculates the **Anion Gap (AG)** - a useful clinical measure to evaluate metabolic acidosis. Users input serum electrolyte levels (Na⁺, Cl⁻, and HCO₃⁻), and optionally, albumin levels to calculate a **corrected AG**. The calculator provides instant interpretation and educational context, including a clinical explanation and a quiz prompt.


## Features

- **Instant Anion Gap calculation** from user-input sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate values.
- **Corrected AG** for albumin if provided.
- Displays:
  - AG formula breakdown
  - Interpretation of normal vs. elevated AG
  - Quiz prompt for educational engagement
  - Clinical relevance of findings
- Simple, clean, mobile-responsive layout.


## Formulae

- **AG = Na⁺ − (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻)**
- **Corrected AG = AG + 2.5 × (4.0 − Albumin)**

## Clinical Use

An elevated anion gap may indicate:
- Lactic acidosis  
- Diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis  
- Renal failure  
- Ingestion of toxins (e.g., methanol, ethylene glycol)


## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in any modern browser.
2. Enter the values for:
   - Sodium (Na⁺)
   - Chloride (Cl⁻)
   - Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻)
   - Albumin (optional)
3. Click **Calculate Anion Gap** to view the results and interpretation.
4. Use the educational sections to reinforce learning.
